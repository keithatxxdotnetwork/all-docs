# xx Messenger

[xx Messenger](https://xxmessenger.io/) is a messaging app originally developed by the Elixxir team. The aim of the team was to use the app as a global test and build out the [xxDK](../cmix/xxdk/overview.md)

xx Messgenger is no longer being activly developed but is has functioning [Android](https://links.xx.network/playstore) and [iOS](https://links.xx.network/appstore) app. It can be used but should not be considered "stable".
