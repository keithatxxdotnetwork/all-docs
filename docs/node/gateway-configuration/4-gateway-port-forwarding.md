# 4. Port Forwarding Configuration
In this step you will configure port forwarding to the gateway computer if necessary.

Port forwarding on a router may need be configured if the gateway computer is behind a router. Three pieces of information are needed for configuring port forwarding:
* The port numbers to forward, 15974 and 22840.
* The protocol to use, TCP.
* The [private IP address of the computer](../basic-linux-help#get-public-and-private-ip-addresses).

The specific steps to configure port forwarding on a router vary by device. Instructions for configuring port forwarding are provided by the router manufacturer. One can usually find instruction by searching online for the router manufacturer (Ex. Linksys, TP-Link, etc.) or router model (Ex. E7350, AXE75, etc.) and the phrase "port forwarding". (Ex. Search for [Linksys "port forwarding"](https://googlethatforyou.com?q=Linksys%20%22port%20forwarding%22))
