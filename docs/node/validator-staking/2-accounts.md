# Set On-Chain Identity (Optional)
[xx Chain Validators](https://explorer.xx.network/staking) and [cMixx nodes](https://dashboard.xx.network/nodes) each have unique IDs. All validators have an ID that starts with the number `6`. All cMixx nodes have an ID that end with the letter `C`. An On-chain Identity can be set which will make it easier to identify a node on the network. 

>For example, the xx chain validator [6Wb9wqBLi8iBhpnNqqWDVPcqfRQMkqTZWq9cAsALwC7W68h4](https://explorer.xx.network/accounts/6Wb9wqBLi8iBhpnNqqWDVPcqfRQMkqTZWq9cAsALwC7W68h4) and cMixx node [c6wptSinakErZHrk0SlgGQXExETPYYLB2CwpLNze6FMC](https://dashboard.xx.network/nodes/c6wptSinakErZHrk0SlgGQXExETPYYLB2CwpLNze6FMC) set the On-Chain Identity to `xx west`.
