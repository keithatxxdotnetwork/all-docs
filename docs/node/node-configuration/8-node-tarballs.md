## Verify the integrity of the tarball
:::warning Verify the tarball
Visit the [xx Network Tarball Page](https://xx.network/mainnet-tarballs)

Find the **SHA256 checksum** of the **Node** tarball and compare it with the output of the following command.
```
sha256sum node.tar.gz
```
You will see output similar to below.
```

```
:warning: Please [**get help**](../install-overview#getting-help), if the output does not match the checksum found on the [xx Network Tarball Page](https://xx.network/mainnet-tarballs)
