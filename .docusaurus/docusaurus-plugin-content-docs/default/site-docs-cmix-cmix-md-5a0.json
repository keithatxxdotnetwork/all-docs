  "description": "For cMix, Node and Gateways pair together; every Node has a Gateway. Their relationship is a Scheduler-Worker design. In the initial design, this will be tiered with a Scheduling server orchestrating Nodes that then orchestrate their Gateways, which then pass schedules onto Clients. The Scheduling server takes its instruction from the blockchain; network participation is defined by staking and consensus. The network will rapidly remove scheduling functions from the scheduling server and move them to adjudication by xx chain.",
